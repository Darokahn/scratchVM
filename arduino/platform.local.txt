# Override the path to the partition table file
# NOTE: This path must be relative to the build directory or absolute.
# Placing the CSV in the sketch folder and using a relative path works best.
build.partition_table_path={sketch_path}/custom_partitions.csv

# Override the partition scheme name (optional, but good practice)
build.partition_scheme=custom
