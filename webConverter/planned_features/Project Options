There are a few options I want to add so that your project can run with the balance of quality and performance that *you* choose.

-   The converter currently pixelates every image in your project to 32x32. 
    That's very small! It keeps project sizes down and makes sure they fit on the esp32.
    Once I have some stability with memory and project uploads, 
    I will introduce the option to use higher resolution on some sprites, 
    along with a visual representation of how much memory your project takes up. 
    If you use too much, the site will let you know.

-   If your project runs too slowly, you can improve performance 
    by just using a blank background.
    Blank sprites will help too.
    The site will have an option to replace your sprites with small colored rectangles 
    instead of full, detailed sprites.

-   Right now, projects don't used advanced sprite features like per-pixel collision, 
    all-around rotation, and sprite effects.
    This is because those features are hard for the CPU to do
    and make your project slow.
    I will add options to enable those features in the future, but be warned:
    projects may not perform well.
