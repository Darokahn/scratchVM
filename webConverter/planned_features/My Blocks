Coming Soon: My Blocks
Right now, "My Blocks" aren't working yet, but they're the next feature I'm adding!

When you use a "My Blocks" block in your project, the converter will copy all the code inside that block and paste it right where you used it.
But Wait... What If a My Block Uses Itself?
Imagine you make a "My Block" called "draw a picture," and inside that block, you use "draw a picture" again. Here's what happens:

I start copying the code for "draw a picture"
I see another "draw a picture" inside
I start copying THAT one
I see another "draw a picture" inside THAT one
And it keeps going... forever!

This is called recursion - when something uses itself. It's like standing between two mirrors and seeing infinite reflections.
The Solution
To keep the converter from getting stuck forever, I'll add a limit on how many times a My Block can call itself. This way, your projects will always work smoothly.
Later on, I might allow unlimited recursion - as long as the chip has enough memory to handle it.
