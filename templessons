Lesson 1:

- Computer Architecture lesson. Can be cut, not incredibly necessary for the class.

- Get started with educator scratch accounts

- Intro to scratch lesson

- Restrictions presentation

Lesson 2:

- Build template game as a class

- Show students how to upload their games to the compiler, change settings, etc.

- Remind students of restrictions

- Encourage students to build their own game, either starting from the template or from "scratch". lol

- Use rest of time to do this, and encourage finishing the game at home.

Lesson 3:

- Give students time to finish their game

- Tell students that the main character of their game will be engraved on the back of their gameboy

- Give them time to design their main character specially, and instruct them to make sure it's obvious which character they want engraved.

- Take status on who has their game finished. Approach lesson 4 with this information in mind.

Lesson 4:

- If most students have their game finished:
    
    - Give 15-ish minutes to put on any finishing touches, then accept game presentations from several students

    - While students present, ensure they follow requirements and remind them where corrections are necessary

- If not:
    
    - Any students who are finished may volunteer to present their game. Spend at most 20 mins. Ensure requirements are followed.

    - After, send students off to independent work.

- Tally which colors of boxes students want

Lesson 5:

    - Pass out circuit components and boxes

    - Go through presentation of how to put components together and wire them properly

    - Show students how to use website interface to upload their games

    - Use 3D pens to secure all components

    - Troubleshoot and debug. Good luck.

Lesson 6:
