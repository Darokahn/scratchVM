1. Your project needs to have a decent starting organizer (everything should reset properly when you press green flag)

The basic steps are:
1. download your scratch project
2. visit utstem.github.io/scratch-converter
3. find your scratch project on your file system
4. drag it onto the page
5. adjust settings as you need to
6. select "upload"
7. select the port with your microcontroller on it
8. wait for a successful upload message
9. these things can have some funky errors. Be willing to try again.
